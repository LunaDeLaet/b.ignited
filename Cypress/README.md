# b.ignited Cypress Tweakers task

In this little project, I made my first two tests with Cypress, a JavaScript end to end testing framework.

In these tests, I had to check whether the last post of yesterday on tweakers.net had a name and date. In the second version, I made it more dynamic, so the test can be reused on another day.


How to install and run the tests:
-
1. Download all the files from the folder "cypress-tweakers"
2. Enter in "cypress-tweakers" folder inside terminal: npm install
3. Enter: npx cypress open
4. Select "E2E Testing"
5. Select browser of choice and "Start E2E Testing"
6. Select the test you want to run
7. Watch the test run!
